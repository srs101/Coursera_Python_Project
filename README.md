# Coursera_Python_Project
This is my repository for submitting my assignment for getting my Coursera certificate  
I have uploaded the same assignemnet twice,
as once I ran it Collab and then from my local machine. (Just to verify if the graph is rendering properly).
Plotly works well on Google Collab and Skill Networks labs environment but might not render on local machines or
Jyputer notebooks due to some issues.
